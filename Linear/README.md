Problem Domain : 
Develop a linear regression model to find out the relationship between sales and other variables.

Approach Used:
1. Understanding the variables in the data set and study about the Industry
2. Created hypothesis and validated
3. Identified the statistical model to use- used linear regression model as the dependent variable is continuous
4. Cleaned the data set and removed any outliers - used boxplot and quartile
5. Built linear regression model.
6. Checked which variables are significant by looking at p values
7. Preformed different tests like multicollinearity test, Homoscadasticity test, Normality test, Auto Correlation, MAPE.


Files:
1. linear.R = contains the R code of the model
2. data.csv = the dataset 
3. linear_output.csv = the output saved in csv file wih prediction column
4. linear_regression.docx = the detail explaination of the solution
