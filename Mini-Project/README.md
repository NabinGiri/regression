Problem Domain : House Price Prediction.


Approach Used:

1. Understanding the variables in the data set.
2. Created hypothesis and validated
3. Identified the statistical model to use- used linear regression model as the dependent variable is continuous
4. Cleaned the data set and removed any outliers - used boxplot and quartile
5. Built Linear regression model.
6. Checked which variables are significant by looking at p values and business reasons.
7. Preformed different tests like multicollinearity test, Homoscadasticity test, Normality test, Auto Correlation, MAPE.

Files:

1. house.R = contains the R code of the model
2. Data.csv = the dataset
3. house_prediction.csv = the output saved in csv file
4. house_prediction.docx = the detail explaination of the solution
